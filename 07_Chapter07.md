# Chapter 7: Surviving the Liquorice Jungle

Welcome back, fearless adventurer! In our previous chapter, we explored the sweet and wondrous Gumdrop Mountains, facing many challenges and discovering the secrets that lie within. Now, we must journey onward to the next obstacle in our path: the Liquorice Jungle.

Our map tells us that the Liquorice Jungle is a dense forest of tall, black trees with vines that twist and tangle around them like writhing snakes. The ground is soft and sticky, with streams of thick, black syrup that run through the underbrush like rivers. But don't be tempted to drink from them, as they may be poisonous as research has shown [1].

As we make our way through the jungle, the air becomes thick with the overwhelming scent of liquorice and we hear strange animal noises amongst the trees. Some of the creatures of Candyland have cautiously described hearing strange whispers, almost like the trees are speaking amongst themselves [2]. Take note, adventurer, for the jungle has the capacity to play tricks on us.

To survive the Liquorice Jungle, it is important that we remember the lessons we have learned thus far. We must stay focused, remain adaptable, and above all, keep a sharp mind. As we move further into the jungle, we may encounter challenges such as poison dart shooting monkeys guarding their banana trees, or licorice gummy bears viciously guarding their territory, but we can overcome them with cunning and quick thinking.

So, get ready, adventurer, and let's navigate our way through the Liquorice Jungle to discover the next piece of The Secret Map to Candyland.
# Chapter 7: Surviving the Liquorice Jungle - The Trippy Tale

As our brave adventurer continued to make their way through the Gumdrop Mountains, the sky suddenly darkened and the air grew thick with a sticky, syrupy scent. Suddenly, before their very eyes, the vibrant colors of Candyland began to transform into an eerie black and white hue. 

Petrified, our adventurer found themselves in the midst of the Liquorice Jungle, with trees that seemed to dance around them. The vines wrapped around each trunk and continued to tangle and twist, as though trying to ensnare our hero.

As our adventurer made their way through the Liquorice Jungle, they were overcome with paranoia and could hear faint whispers coming from the trees around them. An owl perched on a nearby branch spoke to them in hushed tones, telling them how to survive in this menacing jungle.

"Watch out for the Poison Dart Shooting Monkeys," the owl warned, "for they are fiercely protective of their banana trees and will shoot anyone who gets too close."

The adventurer kept their wits about them and devised a plan to distract the monkeys. They threw licorice sticks on the ground, and as the monkeys scrambled to grab them, the adventurer quickly climbed up the banana tree and grabbed a bunch of bananas with ease.

Continuing through the jungle, the adventurer came upon a group of licorice gummy bears that were no match for their clever thinking. One bear after the other fell prey to the adventurer's tricks, allowing them to safely make their way through the jungle unscathed.

Finally, as our adventurer emerged from the Liquorice Jungle, they breathed a sigh of relief and looked back to see the jungle transformed back into its original lush and vibrant state.

Exhausted but triumphant, the adventurer continued on their journey towards the next piece of The Secret Map to Candyland, excited for the adventures that lay ahead.
